# Connect4

## Introduction

A Connect 4 game playing AI by implementing minimax with alpha-beta pruning and genetic algorithm. It doens't make the perfect move every time. But it is a fairly intelligent player and doesn't take much time to make a move. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the weights in the heuristic function. You can play against it here: https://whismura.github.io/connect4

A perfect solver has been built by Dan Garcia, a professor of Computer Science at Berkeley, and here is the link to the solver (http://cloud.cs.berkeley.edu:8090/gcweb/ui/game.jsp?game=connect4 )(the link is not working at the moment I post this, but here is a youtube video showing how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkxmXBY7yQ)

The code of the minimax algorithm is in src/connect4Logic, written in TypeScript.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
